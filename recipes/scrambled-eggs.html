        Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish that can be whipped up quickly and easily. 
        To make scrambled eggs, you start by cracking eggs into a bowl and whisking them together until the yolks and whites are fully blended. 
        Next, you add a splash of milk or cream, a pinch of salt, and some freshly ground black pepper to the mixture.
         The eggs are then cooked over medium heat in a nonstick pan, with butter or oil, until they start to set. 
         At this point, you use a spatula to gently stir the eggs, breaking them up into small curds as they continue to cook. 
         When the eggs are cooked to your liking, you take the pan off the heat and transfer the eggs to a plate. 
         Scrambled eggs can be served as is or with a variety of toppings, such as chives, cheese, salsa, or hot sauce.
